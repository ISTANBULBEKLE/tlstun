Command tlstun provides client and server providing basic VPN over TLS.

Client part is expected to be run locally and used by local services as a
socks5 proxy. Client establishes TLS session to the server part running on
some remote host that performs outgoing requests on behalf of requests made
over connections to the client part. Communication between client and server
is multiplexed over a single TLS session, this reduces TLS handshake
overhead.

Client and server authenticate each other with certificates, they can be
created with openssl or https://github.com/artyom/gencert
